With God’s help and his mother’s heroism, Jallah lived in remote villages, hid from rebel commanders recruiting child soldiers, and narrowly escaped being a child soldier during the Liberian Civil Wars.

Few years later, Jallah convinced his mother to send him back to school during the first “cease fire” agreement between warring factions. Because she couldn’t afford to send him to school, he had to sell doughnuts and water bottles on the streets of Monrovia to obtain his own elementary school tuition until a church organization began to pay his tuition in Monrovia, Liberia.

When the ceasefire ended, Jallah and his family were forced to live in refugee camps in Guinea and Ivory Coast and, later, as refugees in the United States.  After arriving in the United States, Jallah completed high school and matriculated into college.

Each year, YesLiberia’s Tuition Assistance Program sponsors 100 students across Liberia. YesLiberia, a 100% volunteer-run organization, has worked with more than 25 schools—impacting the lives of approximately thousands of students with academic supplies, leadership training, and tuition assistance.

In 2017, Jallah was selected as the Global Leader of GivingTuesday in Liberia. GivingTuesday is a community of millions, working in dozens of countries, with 60 Global Leaders, representing all causes, issues, faiths, and political views, striving toward a generous and just world.
